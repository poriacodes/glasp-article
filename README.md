## **Introduction**
[Glasp](https://glasp.co/) (Greatest Legacy Accumulated as Shared Proof) is a free browser-extension-based social web highlighter. It enables users to highlight and note-down ideas from web pages and share them with like-minded people without switching between the webpage and a note-taking app.

Glasp aims to solve the problem of knowledge isolation by ensuring an easy way to annotate and share ideas.

Instead of leaving your knowledge, insights, and experiences in personal spaces such as note-taking apps where no one can access them, with Glasp, you can capture online content with coloured highlighting options, which are automatically curated to your Glasp homepage.

These highlights can be tagged, searched for, linked to, and shared on various platforms, including Twitter, Teams, and Slack.

The Glasp web extension is available on [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/glasp-social-web-highligh/blillmbchncajnhkjfdnincfndboieik) if you are using Google Chrome Browser or [Safari App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ng/app/glasp-social-web-highlighter/id1605690124?mt=12) if you using Safari Browser.
